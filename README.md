**Talent-matching Platform**


My role. Web developer

Project description.

Developed with my team during a hackathon to enhance Algerian youth's experience, this platform connects aspiring footballers with recruiters:

1. Athlete Interface: Create profiles, showcase skills, and upload videos.
2. Recruiter Interface: Browse players, evaluate talent, and connect.
3. Public Interface: View public profiles and discover emerging talent.

The platform simplifies scouting, giving young athletes better visibility and recruitment opportunities.
